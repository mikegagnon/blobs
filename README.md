## 1. Git

Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/). Git is a "source-code management"
tool. I.e., it helps you manage your source code.

Imagine you're writing an essay. You finish your first draft and save it as "essay-draft-1.txt." Then you save it again as "essay-draft-2.txt" and start working on your second draft. This way, you can always go back to the first draft, in case you end up messing things up in the second draft.

Git helps you manage multiple drafts of software, so you can go back to earlier versions in case you mess things up. Git also also helps with other software-development tasks such as downloading and uploading software (from/to places like github.com).
